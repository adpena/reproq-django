**Deterministic Background Tasks for Django 6.0+ powered by Go.**

Reproq is a production-grade tasks backend that combines the ease of Django with the performance and reliability of a Go-based runner. It uses PostgreSQL as its only dependency—no Redis or RabbitMQ required.

## Key Features

- **Postgres-Only**: Uses `SKIP LOCKED` for high-performance, atomic task claiming.
- **Deterministic**: Every task has a `spec_hash` (SHA256). Identical tasks can be automatically de-duplicated.
- **Strict Isolation**: The Go worker invokes Django tasks via a strict JSON-over-stdin protocol.
- **Django Native**: Implements the Django 6.0 `BaseTaskBackend` API.
- **Periodic Tasks**: Built-in support for cron-like scheduling managed via Django models.
- **Monitoring**: Beautiful Django Admin integration to view, retry, and replay tasks.
- **Worker Heartbeats**: Track active worker nodes and their health in real-time.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retry delays that scale with failure count.

## ⚡ Quickstart

### 1. Install
```bash
pip install reproq-django
```

### 2. Configure Settings
Add `reproq_django` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and configure the `TASKS` backend:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    "reproq_django",
]

TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "reproq_django.backend.ReproqBackend",
    }
}
```

### 3. Install the Worker
Reproq can automatically download or build the Go binary for you:
```bash
python manage.py reproq install
```
*This command detects your OS/Architecture and fetches the correct pre-built binary from GitHub. No Go installation required!*

### 4. Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py reproq migrate-worker
```

### 5. Start the Worker
```bash
python manage.py reproq worker
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Defining and Enqueueing Tasks
Use the standard Django 6.0 `@task` decorator:

```python
from django.tasks import task

@task(queue_name="high-priority")
def send_welcome_email(user_id):
    # logic here
    return f"Email sent to {user_id}"

# Enqueue for background execution
result = send_welcome_email.enqueue(123)

# Wait for result (optional)
result.wait(timeout=5)
print(result.result) # "Email sent to 123"
```

### Periodic Tasks (Cron)
Define periodic tasks in the Django Admin or via the `PeriodicTask` model...

---

## advanced Features

### Concurrency Control (Lock Key)
Prevent multiple tasks from operating on the same resource simultaneously:

```python
@task
def process_user(user_id):
    pass

# Ensure only one task for 'user_123' runs at a time
process_user.enqueue(123, lock_key="user_123")
```

### Workflows (Chains & Groups)
Execute tasks in sequence or parallel:

```python
from reproq_django.workflows import chain, group

# Sequential execution
chain(task_a, task_b, task_c).enqueue()

# Parallel execution
group(task_1, task_2, task_3).enqueue()
```

## 🖥 Management Commands

The `reproq` command is your primary tool for managing the task system.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `python manage.py reproq worker` | Starts the Go worker to process tasks. |
| `python manage.py reproq beat` | Starts the Go scheduler for periodic tasks. |
| `python manage.py reproq check` | Validates your settings and database connectivity. |
| `python manage.py reproq migrate-worker` | Applies Go-specific SQL optimizations (if any). |

## 🔍 Monitoring & Management

Reproq comes with a powerful Django Admin interface.

1. **Task List**: View all tasks, their status, queues, and execution times.
2. **Details**: See the exact arguments (`spec_json`), the return value, or the full traceback if it failed.
3. **Replay**: Select any task and use the "Replay selected tasks" action. This creates a fresh copy of the task and enqueues it, perfect for manual retries after fixing a bug.
4. **Periodic Tasks**: Manage your cron schedules directly from the UI.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

You can customize the backend behavior in `settings.py`:

```python
TASKS = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "reproq_django.backend.ReproqBackend",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "DEDUP_ACTIVE": True,      # Coalesce identical tasks if already READY/RUNNING
            "TIMEOUT_SECONDS": 900,     # Max execution time before worker kills the task
            "MAX_ATTEMPTS": 5,          # Retries for failed tasks
        }
    }
}

# Path to the Go binary (if not in PATH)
REPROQ_WORKER_BIN = "/usr/local/bin/reproq"
```

---

## 📋 Checklist for Production

- [ ] Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set if not using Django's default DB configuration.
- [ ] Set `REPROQ_WORKER_BIN` if the binary is in a custom location.
- [ ] Configure `MAX_ATTEMPTS` and `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for your workload.
- [ ] Set up a process supervisor (like Systemd or Supervisor) for `python manage.py reproq worker`.
- [ ] If using periodic tasks, ensure `python manage.py reproq beat` is also running (only one instance needed).
